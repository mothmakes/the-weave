# The Weave: A New Beginning

A Minecraft Vanilla+ modpack designed as an optional addon for 1.20.4+ play. Users without the pack will be able to enjoy a similar experience on a Weave server, but without a lot of quality-of-life features such as voice chat and game replays.

## How to Setup a Server

1. Download the desired `.mrpack` from this repositories Github releases.
2. Download and install [mrpack-install](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install), a tool for creating Minecraft servers from Modrinth modpacks.
3. Run the command `mrpack-install <path-to-mr>` from the directory you want the server to appear in.
4. Once the command exits, there will be a single `.jar` file. Run the file with the command `java -jar <file>`.
5. You may need to configure other mods, such as the [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) mod.
